# What is Idena?
Idena is the first proof-of-person blockchain based on democratic principles. Every node is linked to a cryptoidentity â€“ one single person with equal voting power and mining income. It is one of the most decentralized blockchains with thousands of unique miners joining the network.

To start mining Idena, you need to prove you are a unique human. It does not require the disclosure of any personal data (no KYC). You have to appear online when the validation ceremony starts and solve a series of flip-tests (CAPTCHAs).
